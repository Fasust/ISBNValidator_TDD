# ISBNValidator_TDD
ISBN Validator, built this to practice Test Driven Development (TDD)

I followed the Lynda Course ["Practical Test-Driven Development for Java Programmers"](https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Practical-Test-Driven-Development-Java-Programmers/777389-2.html) by Matt Greencroft.

## Notes From Class

- Workflow: Red -> Green -> Refactor

- To get to green: Only write the minimum amount of code to make all tests pass (even if you know its wrong in the long run)
- Start with Red to make sure that the new test executes as expected
- Each Test must check one **single** peace of logic
